# PlexusOne Tasks

## Open

### Desktop App - Current

- [ ] **Scroll position indicator**: Display line position (e.g., "123/615") while scrolling through terminal scrollback. Shows current position relative to total lines.

- [ ] **macOS app icon**: Create a polished, "glassy" macOS-friendly icon for PlexusOne/Nexus. Should follow Apple HIG with proper squircle shape, gradients, and depth effects.

- [ ] **Scrollbar visibility**: Verify scrollbar thumb appears and is draggable when there's scrollback content (native scrollback, not tmux).

## Feature Roadmap

Features to make PlexusOne Desktop the best tool for developers using AI assistants.

### High Impact

#### Input Detection (Foundation)

Detect when any AI agent is waiting for user input. This is the foundational feature that enables alerts and agent-specific UI.

**Universal patterns to detect:**

| Pattern | Example | Agent |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Yes/No prompts | `[Y/n]`, `[y/N]`, `(yes/no)` | All |
| Permission prompts | `? Allow clipboard access` | Claude Code |
| Question prompts | `? Which option...` | Claude Code, Kiro |
| Raised hand | `🙋`, `✋`, `🤚` | Gemini |
| Continue prompts | `Press Enter to continue` | Various |
| Input cursor | `> `, `? `, `>>> ` | REPLs, shells |
| Approval requests | `Do you want to proceed?` | All |
| Selection prompts | `Select an option (1-4):` | Various |

**Detection approach:**

- [ ] Monitor terminal output stream in real-time
- [ ] Pattern matching with configurable regex rules
- [ ] Track cursor position (waiting at prompt vs mid-output)
- [ ] Detect output pause + cursor at line start
- [ ] Emoji detection for visual indicators (🙋, ✋, ⏸️)
- [ ] Track time since last output (distinguish thinking vs waiting)
- [ ] Learn from user responses (ML enhancement later)

**State machine:**

```
┌─────────┐    output    ┌─────────┐
│  Idle   │ ──────────▶  │ Running │
└─────────┘              └────┬────┘
     ▲                        │
     │                   pause + pattern
     │                        │
     │    user input     ┌────▼────┐
     └─────────────────  │ Waiting │  ◀── ALERT!
                         └─────────┘
```

#### Input Alerts

Desktop notifications when AI is waiting for user input. Builds on Input Detection.

| Claude Code | Purple | Thinking spinner, tool use, permission requests | Approve (y), Reject (n), Interrupt |
| Kiro CLI | Blue | Spec mode, steering, agent flow | Accept spec, Edit spec, Stop |
| GitHub Copilot | Gray | Suggestion pending, explanation mode | Accept, Reject, Explain |
